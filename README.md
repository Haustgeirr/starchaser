# Starchaser

This is a Unity project, made solo in 48 hours for
[Ludum Dare 48](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/starchaser). There is a
playable version at [itch.io](https://haustgeirr.itch.io/starchaser).

## Details

A slow-burn exploration roguelike. Set in a top-down 2D space.

Instructions:

Reach all five artefacts without running out of fuel or power. Don't crash in to
stars.

Controls:

- W - increase thrust
- A/D - Turn Left/Right
- Space - Apply breaks.

Tough one this time. I wasn't able to commit the full 48-hrs sadly and so I had
to cut a lot of content. Not least of all sound. Normally I'd cram something
janky in last-minute, but couldn't manage it this time. I definitely like where
this is going and will do a version 2 with some of the more 'Nice-To-Haves' in
there.

Thanks for playing!
